The Andhra Pradesh Cabinet approved the relocation of the Oberoi Group's "Mumtaz Hotel" project from Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) land to a different location in Tirupati rural. This decision follows significant public opposition from devotees and religious leaders concerned about the project's proximity to the sacred Tirumala hills.  The Oberoi Group, initially allocated 20 acres of TTD land in 2021, will now receive 38 acres in Peruru village.  Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu's firm stance against privatizing TTD land played a crucial role in the relocation.

* **Government Policy and Decision-Making:** The role of the Andhra Pradesh Cabinet and Chief Minister Naidu in addressing the controversy and making the relocation decision is highlighted.
* **Land Allocation and Exchange:**  The details of the land allocation and exchange between the Oberoi Group and the government are discussed.

* Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu declared that no TTD land would be used for privatization.

In Short
Cabinet okays Mumtaz hotel relocation from TTD lands
Oberoi gets 38 acres in Tirupati rural instead
Chandrababu Naidu says no privatisation in TTD lands
The Andhra Pradesh Cabinet has approved the relocation of the controversial ‘Mumtaz Hotel’ project by the Oberoi Group from the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) lands to an alternative location in Tirupati rural.
The decision follows sustained opposition from devotees, religious leaders, and locals over the project's location near the sacred Tirumala hills.
The Oberoi Group, which was allotted 20 acres of land in 2021 under the previous YSRCP government’s Tourism Policy, will now receive 38 acres of alternative land in Peruru village, Tirupati rural mandal.

This comes in exchange for the originally allotted 25 acres of land within the TTD premises in Tirupati RS village. The Cabinet has cleared the cancellation of the original allotment and authorised the execution of a formal land exchange deed.
The 38 acres at Peruru had been allotted in 2012 to Vaishnavi Infra Ventures & Resorts Limited for a “Temples of India” theme park. Of this, 30.32 acres were handed over, and in 2021, 20 acres of that land were earmarked for the Oberoi Group’s resort project.
Mounting objections over the project's proximity to the sacred Alipiri Srivari Padalu area, and fears of religious sanctity being compromised, led to widespread protests. In February 2025, sadhus and temple priests launched a hunger strike, demanding immediate cancellation of the resort project.
In March, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu responded decisively, announcing the
cancellation of all tenders related to the Mumtaz Hotel
and declaring, “No Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) land will be used for privatisation.”
Criticising the previous administration’s approach, Naidu said, “You’ve seen the last government, when they gave permission for the construction of Mumtaz hotels, Devalok project etc. They changed the name, but we told them we can’t give permission for the same.”
The Oberoi Group reportedly offered to serve only vegetarian food at the resort to align with the spiritual nature of the region, but the government stood firm. “No private entities will be allowed in this sacred place,” Naidu reiterated, later assuring that the government would help the company shift to an alternative location.
